  Project Title: Pheme: Birds of a Feather Tweet Together
  <br />
  <br />
  Description: Pheme is a real-time visualization of tweets. Select a location you're interested in by scrolling and zooming the provided map. Pheme will automatically stream tweets from this location in real-time, and place them on the map. Hover over a point on the map to see the text of the associated tweet. In addition, Pheme will try its best to identify clusters of tweets that represent real-world events, like a baseball game or concert, as tweets come in. A list of the tweets in each cluster is shown on the sidebar to the right (each color indicates one cluster of tweets); clusters that have been identified will appear as arrows on the map, and be colored appropriately as well.
