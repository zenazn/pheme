  Project Title: Pheme 2.0: Birds of a Feather Tweet Together
  <br />
  <br />
  Description: Pheme is a real-time visualization of tweets. Select a location you're interested in by scrolling and zooming the provided map. Pheme will automatically stream tweets from this location in real-time, and place them on the map. Hover over a point on the map to see the text of the associated tweet. In addition, Pheme will try its best to identify clusters of tweets that represent real-world events, like a baseball game or concert, as tweets come in. A list of the tweets in each cluster, along with a word cloud summarizing the cluster, is shown on the sidebar to the right (each color indicates one cluster of tweets); clusters that have been identified will appear as arrows on the map, and be colored appropriately as well. Finally, the frequency of tweets being received by the visualization over time is displayed below the map in a line chart; select an area on the line chart to only see tweets from that time frame.
